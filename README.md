## Overview

### The Project

Users should be able to:

- Click Tracking: The click counter should accurately record and display the total number of clicks made by the user.
- Resetting the Counter: Users may need to reset the click counter to start counting from zero or to clear the previous count. This option allows them to begin a new tracking session or reset the count for a specific purpose.
